<b>TITLE:</b> 04 - Web API's - Code Quiz

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
This repository contains the fourth homework assignment for the Coding Bootcamp conducted by the University of Birmingham. This homework assignment was about creating a short and interactive quiz application, designed specially for coding bootcamp students who wish to judge their progress in coding compared to their peers.

The page throws some questions related to coding at the student, who must answer all the questions within a time limit of 90 seconds. There are 5 questions in this quiz, each with 4 choices. The page informs the student whether they answer correctly or incorrectly with every question. The student is informed in the very beginning of the quiz that their time/score will be deducted by 10 seconds with every incorrect answer.

The quiz has been created and styled using the very basics of the programming languages learnt over the period of the bootcamp so far: HTML, CSS stylesheets, and Bootstrap. Students can easily play this quiz on any device, whether laptop or phone. This quiz application is made interactive and user-frienldy, all thanks to the use of JavaScript as the third programming language, because of which the student attempting the quiz is able to attentively answer all 5 questions, and then submit and store their high-score at the end of the quiz.

Answering quick questions under time pressure can be fun for some people, and stressful for others. This quiz is designed for students who are keen to compete with themselves within a reasonable time limit, and compare their own scores after each attempt (the score being the time limit itself, for the student to judge between their quickness and their accuracy of answers). A short demo is shown in the animated gif below:
